        Weathermail is a Django app that allows users to enter their email address, select the
        closest large US city to them, and subscribe to get weather-based emails.  A service
        is included that will send out one email per day to each subscriber whose body is
        determined by the current day's forcast.
        
        This is version 0.1.1 of this app.
